despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
if you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at britney spears' movie starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch
those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know
does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago
it would work much better as a one hour tv documentary
the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard
a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well detailed characters
the overall vibe is druggy and self indulgent , like a spring break orgy for pretentious arts majors
i liked this film a lot
while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming of age films it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys' story
bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation
great character interaction
the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries
an instantly forgettable snow and stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday season product
well shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons
this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002
jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness
roman polanski 's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler 's list' it is more than merely a holocaust movie
an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment
a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households
payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he 's the best brush in the business
intriguing and stylish
the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood
a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot
wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
there are moments it can be heart rending in an honest and unaffected \( and gentle \) way
it 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries there 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls
a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences
godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence
arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation
assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne 's novel
all of the filmmakers' calculations ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness
eight legged freaks \? no big hairy deal
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r sum loaded with credits like girl in bar 3
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple espresso endurance challenge
director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve
as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca n't remember a single name responsible for it
even in terms of the low grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash
a small movie with a big impact
it 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects
completely awful iranian drama as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque
the most anti human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero
while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine
if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks rent this movie and enjoy !
displaying about equal amounts of naivet , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential
parking lot located clear out beyond the mall inside of the hotel makes for quite a long walk pool is also not located very wisely if you want to go swimming you have to walk thru the mall in your swimsuit and towel to get to the pool stupid ! it 's all about how much more they can extract from your pocket before you make it to your room nhotel has odd smell throughout room was clean , although the door on the entertainment center was ripped off bathroom was roomy and tub very large and welcoming nmy husband and i were approached twice by women in the hotel asking if we wanted company uh , how about hell no ! ni wo n't be going back here i only went here for a medical convention for work
no , no , no , no that 's all i can say if you are planning on eating here n nmy daughter and i went in today , on a sunday afternoon , because we could n't find another mexican restaurant that was open on sunday in central phoenix the service was fine but the food was awful the beans tasted like they came from a can \( rosarita brand \) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason we each ate only half of our food before leaving n nwhen the waiter asked how the food was , i told him and all he did was say he was sorry no offer to bring something else or comp one of our half eaten meals n nmacayo 's on central used to have fresh food , now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can you can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen for the prices they charge , you have a right to expect better food n ni will never go there again
we ate breakfast here a few days ago since we are staying at mandalay bay note to future hotels guests skip this and go to raffles or citizens instead n nwe are pretty sure that most of what they serve for breakfast is pre made and sitting in chafing dishes in the back everything came out within 90 seconds none of it was hot and it was definitely not cooked to order i wo n't waste time a long review with detailed food items and maybe their lunch or dinner is better but 50 bucks for premade breakfast no way ! n none star yuk ! ! !
i love this location the people are courteous and friendly , and i have never had to wait in line n nto make a very , very , very long story short i am a recent convert to wells fargo tom quinsler , the branch manager , for this location went out of his way to assist me in the cash purchase of a home due to the large nature of the transactions , my money could have been held for weeks until the bank was certain i was not a terrorist or a thief tom inserted himself in the situation and allowed me access to my money so that i could meet the date requirements for my home purchase n ntom risked a slap on the hand to meet a customers ' need , and that is customer service that we just no longer see my thanks to tom and his staff for making what could have been a nightmare into a good experience !
a girlfriend and i hired dianne for our hot mommas birthday party dianne did an amazing job she painted all of the children 's faces , then all the moms most of us had images from websites we wanted her to recreate \( think cirque du soliel \) and they turned out better than the original ! we got a lot of attention when we went dancing very talented awesome personality we 'll be calling dianne again
i ordered the chicken marsala burger and i do not recommend it , it was soggy and had a weird texture my boyfriend ordered the black and blue burger , it was just average the fries were delicious and they have good dipping sauces the staff was very friendly and the service was quick but the food was just ok
so after driving by this place everyday i decided to give it a shot i originally went there on a lunchdate thinking it was a sit down and order establishment well i was wrong so at that point we went elsewhere so i went back for carryout tonight in a nutshell i 'm not impressed by it all , but there are some silver linings n nservice meh , middle of the road not bad , not good the employees looked annoyed and did n't want to be there but i was asked about sides and options and got a thank you after transaction so i ca n't burn them too bad for not whistling while they work n6 10 n nfood quality i ordered the steak quesadilla cause i love fried tortillas and lots of cheese inside well , i was very disapointed granted they press the tortillas there and fry it up in front of you , mine was not very fried i worked at restaurants and cooked quesadillas on mexi night and mine were always crispy and hot this one was merely warmed up and retained little heat during the 1 mile drive home while the quesadilla was n't much better than taco bells version , the chips and queso and guacamole were excellent very good guac ! ! it was rich and chunky unlike canned stuff maybe i 'll just stick to burritos if i go there cause the steak was tasty n5 10 only because of the guac , 3 10 without it n nprice 5 for that undercooked quesadilla is a sham 3 tops the chips and queso were also a bit pricey at 3 i spent 8 50 on the quesadilla , chips , queso and guacamole i felt like it was a 5 meal in the end n3 10 n nexperience vibe very plain much like other tex mex joints like qdoba and chipotle , only a little worse the dining setup is awkward and weirdly lit n5 10 n noverall 19 40 n nwhen the sides impress me more than the main dish i can only give two stars tops i m sure it would be closer to 3 if i ordered the burrito since that s just easier than a quesadilla but i do n't really like burritos that much , so guys lets work on that tortilla frying and better portions !
this place has great potential but the execution is all wrong there 's an outside and an inside , outside has a pool that had these really pretty floating light up orbs in it there 's a bar outside and a bar inside that 's good ! \) n nthey allow men to dress in shambles at this place sneakers and golf shirts , shorts and flip flops i 'm supposed to swoon at this \? blah every girls crazy about a sharp dressed man n nif you are going to allow that then make a night swim party , you got a pool make it like some of the poolside clubs in miami throw on a coverup and a bikini and swim till late in the night i got in free , guy friend even though he was a local , had to pay a whopping 10 n ndancers were tight and some of the cocktail servers were looking good , but the vip table chicks had on jorts and like knee high socks and sneakers \? \? \? \? wtf \? i do n't even wear that to the beach it was a mess does not represent an upscale club in vegas and definitely not at night n nwe stayed for one drink then left n nget a theme and stick to it and make the dress code consistent
while i have raved about this place in the past , i wanted to once again extol the virtues and , more importantly , the family feel of this place ernie lights up the room with her smile once that happens , the coffee is served , and the service begins then the rest of the breakfast is just a wonderful continuation peg and i went for my birthday \( actually , we try to extend family occasions so that we can visit the family of chefs with whom we have grown since we moved here in ' 97 \) the oj was fresh , the specials are always superb , and there is a continuity in the kitchen that virtually assures that the quality will be stellar we ca n't wait for the new addition this month , and peg and i always will support matt , ernie , and of course christopher ! dr b
the atmosphere is cool great beer selection meatballs were terrible i was here a few times when it first opened and i thought they were okay , but now i think they 've gone down hill i had the spicy pork meatballs and they were very , very hard my fiance was laughing watching us trying to cut through them i had them on top of the parmesan mac n cheese and i liked that well enough n n we also had cheesy bread as an appetizer and we thought the sauce tasted burnt the olives were great i 'd totally go back to drink but i wo n't eat there again there are way too many great restaurants in pittsburgh to suffer through a mediocre meal
we ordered the poutine no gravy and was flavorless ! beer pretzels were gross ! ! ! ran out of caesar dressing so could n't get a salad bottom line , do n't come here for the food just the beer and cute wait staff
only giving a two because it 's 247 drinks blah espresso bleh ! someone walked off with my phone there too when i went to the bathroom wtf ! ! ! employees were extremely unhelpful when asked if they noticed anyone walk up to where i was sitting \( plain view of the counter \) i canceled the phone 30minutes later when i got home , six international calls made from it from the time it was walked off with do n't bother trying to call this place either the phone does n't get answered or at least did n't did i mention the espresso is bleeh \? \?
this is the worst store i 've ever been to i walked in ready to spend some serious cash and not a single person would help me oh a couple of salesman sat and watched tv , and a couple of other salesman made eye contact with me and started to walk toward me but then stopped and turned around oh well , i went to fry 's market place and bought a great leather loveseat , a dining room set and an entertainment center i spent almost 1000 00 there and the staff was really great i do n't recommend pruitts to anyone , go to frys
we always have a good time whenever we hit the luxor ! before , when it was still called ' ra ' it was crowded , it was fun , and there was always someone new to meet n nmy girls and i unknowingly planned our trip to las vegas for memorial day weekend i say unknowingly because i know better than to go to las vegas during a holiday weekend too many people \( i just do n't do big crowds \) , too many drunks , and clubs become too expensive however , it was n't my birthday and that weekend worked so we went n nwe hit lax the last night of our stay in vegas \( sunday night \) we got scammed by some dude selling club passes on the strip \( in front of caesar 's , do n't give him your money \) so we knew it would a rough night of clubbing ahead of us we decided to just go for it and headed to the luxor we were n't on a list , we did n't have passes , we were doing it ' the regular way ' which i have n't done since i first started clubbing \( about 10 years ago \) we expected the cover to be insane , especially when we discovered that ginuwine was performing \( do n't judge me , i still love ginuwine \) we were told that the cover was 20 , but we could expect to pay more by the time we got to the door totally understandable , this is vegas , the goal is to make money n nwe got to the door in record time \( less than an hour of waiting in line , score ! \) , and we only paid 30 to get in i look at this as a bargain because it was a holiday weekend , other clubs were charging much more and there was a performance that night n nthe only real problem we had was that the club was so packed it was really hard to finish my drink without spilling it on myself \( thanks to the thousands of people milling back and forth bumping in to me \) after ginuwine performed a lot of people left so it was easier to dance easier , not easy it was still super packed , no real dancing could be done and getting off the dance floor was very tricky n nover all , we had a great time the luxor never disappoints me it 's always an adventure when we roll through the luxor
hmmm , how to start this one off nasty , dirty , smelly , sleazy , grimy , ugly , depressing , not sure did i mention dirty \? i 'll start with that we could tell from the tiny garage that this place was not frequented for a reason it is just the epitome of sleaziness but it 's not even up to sleazy vegas standards in fact , i 'll go ahead and say it , this place should be on the lower end of fremont st we got in the elevator and a friend had to hold her nose and breath into her hand so she did n't throw up and this was on the way to get some of their world famous chicken wings needless to say , we never got those wings \( see previous review of restaurant \) this place was so depressing and just drained our spirits we had to escape there is a reason they are off the strip and nobody goes there just stay away for the price there are so much better things btw , in n out down past unlv or in the other direction across the 15 !
this place is the best i would recommend the green chili stew w a fried egg !
we came , we ate and i suppose food coma is a sign of conquering the food for our moneys worth i came with my cousins and we were in during the transition from lunch to dinner so we got to sample both collections of food n ni like the interior it has a bit of ambiance compared to most grill spots which like to go basic the plus is the round non stick grill some people might think it 's weird that they only wipe it down with a paper towel , but really it 's all it needs to get it clean compared to the usual grills that need to be replaced and deeply scrubbed i like this kind of grill and the ventilation is decent here so i did n't get too much of that food smell n nmeat is the game and the meat actually was a decent selection the quality and freshness was pretty good n nmy favorites npork belly with a spicy marinate was really nice nkalbi ribs are nt as fatty as other spots , more marbled ntongue and thin sliced beef is always a favorite n ncooked items i like that the foods were more korean prepped than how some do a chinese buffet came for korean so want more of those dishes tempura came out and it was good actually , but i got it fresh off the frying most were okay , but i was n't here to fill on dishes i came for meat ! n nservice the service here is attentive and this was refreshing since most asian establishments do n't have this kind of service the ladies filled out drinks , checked on us often , came to help cook our meats and clean out grill the service was constant , but was unobtrusive and friendly n nlet 's put the things i have a shtick with aside n nbanchan some of the banchan was too salty and some during lunch were n't as cold and crisp as they should i did n't get to have much banchan after the turn over as at that point i was n't feeling it n nradish wraps i love these , after lunch turned over , they took them away \( i would think this is basic like having lettuce or bean paste for the meat n ni normally like chikke , the rice cinnamon drink , but theirs was way too sweet n npricing at 20 compared to other ayce for dinner is n't bad , but i still do n't know if it was a pricepoint i was happy with they have a much better setup , service , etc so i get where they need to keep their price higher i guess i 'm just sad i did n't get a little dessert \( they have fruit , jello \) if i went to wooche i normally keep the 4 difference to grab something sweet to wash out the palette from the heavy flavors it 's easy to say i 'll come for lunch but the kalbi and the thin cut tongue and such is only dinnertime and that 's a bulk of what i want n ni can see myself come back for a few reasons not as busy , i do n't smell as much i think i 'm a fan , but i 'm leaning towards this being a ok so i 'll say it 's a 3 5 star experience
so so so so so so disappointed nwe personally love boutique hotels , service is usually spectacular and there 's usually extra care in putting together the rooms not here we booked two rooms with two queen beds each we got only one room with two queen beds and one room with one king bed thanks \? n nthe ac ca n't be changed to your liking our bathrooms came with two towels for four people we were missing all of our soaps and shampoos carpets are dirty we were also given these basement rooms wheelchair accessibility \? nope no elevators ! they gave us a keurig machine for coffee but making yourself a cup costs two bucks a piece wow n nwe tried to ask the front desk how to get places , but they had no idea slow clap \? n n ni guess the one star is for the free breakfast we received for all our trouble yippee
i guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60 full which can be understandable but we were seated within 5 minutes , but the menus took another 5 minutes to come ni ordered the 4 course of salad , tandoori chicken , mixed vegetables , banana bread pudding , and a chai latte included in the end chicken was very tender and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree bread pudding very very good to finish the gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side main entrees were a bit on the smaller side nthe server was joking around a little , calling my chicken kfc when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard funny guy
very reasonably priced and a higher quality pedicure than i expected i will be returning
worst experience at a salon ever i got burnt during the wash and during the blowout i should have known this was a bad idea when i walked in as soon as i sat down i heard the music turn way up and all these shreeks followed by omg , its friiday ! ! friday dance partaay ! ! ! all the instructors started dancing instead of watching students coloring hair or helping any of the stylists in training whose manikin heads kept falling over and rolling away during my cut and style i managed to hear my stylist talk bad about each student there and hear about how she almost got sent home that day because someone told on her for something the cut turned out great so it might have been worth the 15 then she styled me and it took two days to wash out the hairspray and i looked like i had stuck my finger in a light socket overall i guess it is worth the money next time i will just hit up bjs for happy hour to deal with the burns and mindless chatter of the stylists in training
i 've always liked the auto bell and i go to several around town you can get out of the car while they clean it , or you can sit in your car thru the wash and just drive off w o waiting to get it dried , if you 're in a hurry n ni 've had issues with this particular auto bell recently , though on at least four occasions i 've asked for the trunk of my car to be vacuumed only to find out later it was n't done i 've got an suv that collects a good bit of debris from landscaping supplies , so i 'm always asking they make sure the back gets vacuumed out thoroughly they always seem to acknowledge what i 'm asking , so i do n't know where the disconnect is , but i hate being at the market later only to find out the back has n't even been touched when i go to load my groceries n nsame thing happened just this weekend , except this time i checked before driving off nope had n't even been touched as dirty as when i pulled in the guy whow as drying my car took care of it right away , but it should have been handled when they other guys were doing the vaccuming before it went through the wash a quick trip to the car wash just took longer than expected n nstark contrast to the auto bell in clover i like to go to no communication issues there i ask they make sure the back is vacuumed and it 's done much friendlier staff there , too , in my opinion
this dump is an absolute nightmare and mike lorenzi is thief he gave me an estimate to fix my starter at 320 then called me up and said it needed a new pump and it would be an additional 493 , when we came down to pick the car up he said he also replaced some sort of regulator and a belt and the bill was now 2 , 487 and said he could n't get ahold of me and my wife authorized it i paid it cause i needed the car to go to an important meeting right away and he was saying it had to be done and he saved me over 1 , 000 had i taken it somewhere else later i found out my wife did n't authorize it after about a month i started having problems again and took it back and he said he was too busy to work on it so i took my car to another mechanic who said he did n't replace all that he said and the belt looked like it was taken off another vehicle the mechanic felt he had ripped us off we will be taking him to court
i 've gone to the diamond an many occasions , and it has always been spotty one visit terrible , one visit pretty good , but never great after my visit this past weekend , i guess i 'm calling it quits the bottom line is that it 's not worth going to a place when the odds are the service and food will sorely disappoint n nwe had two people visiting from out of town , and forgot dish was closed , so we figured hey , the diamond was n't too bad last time , let 's go there luckily , there was no wait , the four of us sat down , asked what the specials were and it turned out they were out of the specials two of us then ordered the black bean burger they were out of that too we got some other stuff , and a starter of fried pickles , which were okay my friend asked the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh , because she was thinking about a blt the waiter seemed offended and gave a dismissive , yes then we waited and waited for the food it took way too long to come out n nwe finally got our dishes i was okay with mine , but everyone else was very disappointed it was as if diamond shops for the absolute bottom rung ingredients if you put a salad on a menu , it should be at least somewhat appetizing the small block burger was a sad , ugly thing the tomatoes were hard and without much flavor one person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as disgusting i was embarrassed to have brought friends there n nthe take away lesson here is that it 's great to be a local institution it 's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele but if you 're a restaurant , it 's still all about the food for most of your patrons you need to have quality food and do n't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner especially when you 're charging 9 or more for some plates a lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price n nso the diamond is still a great place to get a drink , but they 've got to overhaul nearly everything when it comes to their food
i 'll have to admit , i thought this mall would rapidly decline over the past 3 years since i wrote my last review with the economic downturn and the overall decline of las vegas , i thought for sure it would suffer however , i was wrong it 's time for a review update n nall of the pros cons from my prior review still hold true the only thing i can add is to the cons this mall has a ton of those annoying kiosks that sell perfume , jewelry cleaning , and other stuff what makes it annoying are the sales people who make cat calls at you as you walk by it feels like i 'm at a middle eastern souk i just act like i ca n't speak english and walk right by them n nbesides that one annoying item , it 's still a solid place to do some shopping there are some great stores here and i 'm surprised they did n't leave during the economic downturn n nreturn factor 95
40 cover for guys , 20 for girls drinks are normal club prices this club reminds me of a 2 story bank \( at the bellagio \) no air ventilation , filled with smoke and jackass bartenders makes me never want to go here again unless either tiesto is spinning , or i get in for free n ni 'll stick with xs or try vanity
literally , this place has the best burger i 've eaten in my entire life so good i went two days in a row i make it a point to come here every time i visit vegas n nonly problem , which i ca n't dock stars for nor would i , this place is only in vegas please please please open up a restaurant in la !
nah my friends did not like the poke seafood salad and i tasted it , it was not good
i love this place n ngreat drinks ngood food nhuge portions n na great place for small group as the servings are made more for a family style service than an entree n ni love it !
love this place ! wish we had one here in ca great vibe once you walk through that door fantastic drinks and goodies ! !
stopped by for an early dinner on saturday night and were quite impressed ! even early though on saturday we had about a 15 minute wait but got a great table on the patio the only take reservations for parties of 8 or more n nstarted off with the edamame dumplings which were fresh and delicious then i had the white shrimp ramen and my husband had the chicken curry panang both were absolutely wonderful ! you could taste the whole grain goodness , yet they both were full of flavor and just enough spiciness to keep that happy feeling in your mouth last i do n't know who was com planing about the portions but they were definitely enough for dinner we ended up with the banana tart dessert which was also wonderful fresh and not overwhelmingly sweet like so many restaurant desserts n noverall a great experience and we will definitely go back
as if losing all your money on the strip from gambling , expensive restaurants , and pricey shopping did n't hurt enough you leave las vegas through a neglected airport with filthy bathrooms , poor dining options and limited seating i know it is just a port of entry departure but dang , could n't the hotels chip in a tiny bit to make a good impression for travelers \? i added one bonus star for their no smoking enforcement
i have been very happy with dawg days the outside is not attractive but the inside is very dog friendly we 've been taking our dog to get his hair cut there for over a year we used to take him to pet smart , who nicked him with the razor on 2 occasions and sent us home with a bleeding dog and not a word of explanation dawg days is family owned , and they genuinely care about the dogs , and when our dog gets nervous , they do n't traumatize him we just got a second dog and he was terrified of the razor , so they gave him a haircut by hand and did n't charge us any extra they keep the dogs in an open pen indoors and do n't lock them in metal crates the staff is frequently in with the dogs giving them love and attention our dog is afraid to walk into pet smart , but in the last year has never become afraid of dawg days , and has never come home bleeding it 's hard , but do n't judge this place by the outside , we have been very happy with their services
i have been getting rony 's scissor cut for the past seven years i have difficult , thick , kinky curly hair and he knows how to make sure it looks good immediately after the cut , and when it fills in too in addition to a great cut , it is a pleasant break to talk and joke with rony while in his chair finally , he has his own place ! his prices are more competitive than in his past shops and and he still gives the best scissor cut in the valley shoulder massage and hot cold towel , and rinse too , if you want
the peppermill defies description refined tackiness utterly craptastic could it be that a flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues \? n nall kidding aside , the best thing about this restaurant is the decor it screams cheesiness and vintage vegas , with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest when was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert \? i love the decor , and make sure that i always step into the lounge , open 24 hours a day , to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to here n nnow to the substance peppermill is an institution it has been around seeming forever , and had a scene from casino filmed there with sharon stone n nthe food is average , at best it is also overpriced the place is best on its breakfast foods , in my humble opinion the omelets are huge , but again , overpriced n nthe appetizer sampler platter is good , but overpriced oddly enough , the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item n ni recommend this place for drinks in the lounge , and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the strip the place , while overpriced , is still cheaper than the buffet and more fun n nare you noticing a trend here \? i will hit you over the head with it one more time overpriced
i did n't realize this place is brought to you by the creators of cheesecake factory well that explains the good food i ordered a calypso mojito , the rare ahi tuna salad , and i shared in some of the fudge cake collision the mojito was pretty good , the ahi tuna was amazing , and the cake was also pretty good combine that with nice decor and decent service and i 'd say it 's worth repeat trips n ni 've been to the other grand lux inside venetian \( technically , this one is the other grand lux \) i think i like the palazzo version better simply for the layout and decor it feels a little more intimate
pho viet nam nfinally another vietnamese place opened today 11 1 2013 n nour favorite place moved , \( phu thahn \) so we have been waiting for something great without traveling far we got lucky , cause this place is it n nappetizer fried egg rolls hard to admit , but these are the best i have had at any restaurant spring rolls up next , and they were also very good , they did nt have that overpowering of mint so that was actually very good both dipping sauces were a very good compliment as well n nentree wife had beef pho , and this actually beat our phoenix fave \( da vang \) awesome i had bbq pork , and was very good as well only downside was that i am not a fan of broken rice , but that is minimal , , , n nnow it will be whether they stay consistent but this will be a definite weekly stop until otherwise n nalso since they just opened the menu is n't full yet i have some suggestions , see if they add them
i want badly to love this place but the few times i 've gone i 've been disappointed \( the cc 's are fine , just fine
totally messed up my order did not care it was crazy how much they did not care was kind of like hey you drove here so might as well take what we got
this is always hit and miss i just went and got the works and added leather treatment my car was dirtier then when i dropped it off i was one of two cars and 12 employees not pleased
just as i said in my review in february , i returned and had the insaladda della casa then the complimenti alla mamma pizza just like before , everything was excellent and i would order it again i just wish i remembered to read my earlier review before returning so i would be sure to order something different all the pizzas sound good and i want to try each one the service was very good our waitress did n't seem to mind that we kept wanting to sample wine before we bought a bottle their wine selection , by the way , is very good and reasonably priced finally , i must add that sitting inside can be a bit noisy when it is crowded temperature permitting , the patio is a better place to sit , eat and chat
i 'm not real easy to impress but i do like this place a nice relaxed crowd a good selection of dance music and beautiful women every ware ! a must stop place for sure just be for warned drinks are not cheap ! ! ! but you are in vegas ! surrounded by beautiful women ! be aware they do have a dress code
service sucks , food bland , too many waiters around asking if you needed anything sometimes too much of a good thing , is n't good
i wanted to like round corner cantina i really did but i have to say , after my first visit here i 'm not dying to come back n nbefore you even enter this place you have to deal with something that is n't really their fault parking and navigating traffic on butler street always a joy ! once i managed to deal with this step and actually entered cantina i was n't really encouraged the music was playing too loudly for my taste in the front room and was n't much better in their back room , which was so dark i had to wonder how people even read their menus if they sit there n nlooking for somewhere a bit quieter and brighter , my dinner companion and i headed to their outdoor patio , where we found high tables and chairs that i honestly thought i 'd fall off of at some point during the meal , they were so unsteady fortunately that never happened , because we were right next to a part of the fence where the beams were extremely splintered just thinking about tipping into them was painful ! n nunfortunately , the service did absolutely nothing to improve my opinion of the place i watched three tables that arrived after us get service no one ever came to our table after we finally flagged a waitress attending to a group a couple tables over , she said she 'd grab our waitress and we waited some more while we waited the waitress that we flagged down went ahead and brought us some water that came in plastic cups i shudder to imagine just how much trash this place discards every day from these cups alone n nafter finally ordering and waiting for what at least was n't an unreasonable amount of time , i was able to enjoy a pretty tasty drink that came in a jar \( they have jars for alcohol but not for your water \? \) but was disappointed with my pork tacos the shells were kind of mushy and the sauce and toppings minimal mine just did n't taste all that special my dinner companion 's fish tacos were actually better i kind of wish we 'd swapped n ni left just feeling let down i honestly would 've been happy to forgive this place 's rustic look and loud music if the service and food were a bit better , but as it is i just do n't see anything here that i 'd want to brave the dreaded butler street traffic again for
i really do n't understand the hype of this place to be honest , had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city , then i would have probably rated it a 3 or 4 the pizza was just ok it was decently greasy and the crust was n't all that special they would n't deliver \( even though i am literally a few blocks from them \) and they do n't accept credit debit card a huge downfall for me
great little family owned place a good portion of the client u00e8le is actually middle eastern , so they 've got to be doing something right the owner , mike , is always around and very friendly , and usually hanging out in the market part of the building there 's a hookah bar upstairs , but having an aversion to hookah , i 've never ventured in the market is neat to look around in and a good place to go for some excellent fresh feta cheese or lamb n non to the food it is fantastic and inexpensive you can get a falafel sandwich and fries for under 5 , but that 's about the cheapest meal on the menu the have a lunch buffet monday friday from 11 3 for 10 it 's a very small buffet and at least half of it is cold food like salads and hummus about 75 of the time , i have no idea what i 'm eating , but i always enjoy it n nas an added bonus , the last time i was there the guy who refilled my water was wearing one of those t shirts with kittens on it their faces on the front , and their butts on the back i do n't know if he was serious or not , but it was pretty amazing
we happened to be going by here and on an impulse decided to stop n nit 's a tiny place right on the road they have a drive through and a walk up window when we visited there were two young , very enthusiastic people inside they had several coffees available , as well as some italian soda my wife had the coffee , i tried the soda we were both very happy with our choices i 'd probably give it 3 5 stars if i could , but i ca n't and the enthusiastic service has to count for something , so we 'll go with four stars n nthey also have a stamp card so you can get a free beverage when you fill it
the complex is beautiful especially around the holidays ! lots of fun activities for kids families the pool with the slide is only open from 10 4 very disappointing considering the 30 night fee to use it ! the rooms are good sized but are very outdated ! ! ! prepare to walk a mile to get to your car if you 're not willing to pay for valet
went there for lunch on july 12 on the 2 for 1 the hotel gave us pizza was ok and ribs were pretty good other than that nothing stood out many things were edible , but not a lot of flavor including the pasta bar where they make it for you go elsewhere this one is a dud !
mike was our server he was knowledgeable great personality very attentive the food and his service was awesome we will definitely be back and ask for him

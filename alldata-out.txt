we devoured breakfast here a few days ago jo we are staying at mandalay chasm note to future hotels guests skip this and go to raffles or citizens instead n nwe are pretty sure that most of what they serve for breakfast is pre made and sitting in chafing dishes in the back everything came out within 90 seconds none of it was hot and it was definitely not overcooked to order i wo n't waste time a long review with detailed food items and ultimately their lunch or dinner is better but 50 bucks for premade breakfast no way ! n none star yuk ! ! !
i liked this location the people are courteous and friendly , and i have never had to wait in line n nto brings a very , very , very long story short i am a recent convert to wells fargo tom quinsler , the branch manager , for this location went out of his pleas to assist me in the cash purchase of a home due to the large nature of the transactions , my money could have been held for weeks until the bank was certain i was not a terrorist or a thief tom inserted himself in the situation and allowed me access to my money so that i could meet the date requirements for my home purchase n ntom risked a slap on the hand to meet a customers ' need , and that is customer service that we just no longer see my thanks to tom and his staff for making what could have been a nightmare into a good experience !

i instructed the chicken marsala burger and i do not proposition it , it was soggy and had a weird texture my boyfriend ordered the black and blue burger , it was just average the hamburgers were delicious and they have good dipping sauces the staff was very friendly and the service was quick but the food was just good
so after drives by this place everyday i determined to dar it a killing i originally visited there on a lunchdate thinking it was a sit down and order establishment quite i was wrong too at that point we went elsewhere so i went back for carryout tonight in a nutshell i 'm not impressed by it all , but there are some silver linings n nservice sooo , midway of the road not lousy , not good the employee looked annoyed and did n't want to be there but i was asked about sides and options and got a thank you after transactions even i headquarter n't burn them too inclement for not whistling while they work n6 10 n nfood quality i ordered the steak quesadilla cause i love fried tortillas and lots of cheese inside well , i was very disapointed granted they press the tortillas there and fry it up in front of you , mine was not very fried i worked at restaurants and cooked quesadillas on mexi night and mine were always crispy and hot this one was merely warmed up and retained little heat during the 1 mile drive home while the quesadilla was n't much better than taco bells version , the chips and queso and guacamole were excellent very good guac ! ! it was rich and chunky unlike canned stuff maybe i 'll just stick to burritos if i go there cause the steak was tasty n5 10 only because of the guac , 3 10 without it n nprice 5 for that undercooked quesadilla is a sham 3 tops the chips and queso were also a bit pricey at 3 i spent 8 50 on the quesadilla , chips , queso and guacamole i felt like it was a 5 meal in the end n3 10 n nexperience vibe very plain much like other tex mex joints like qdoba and chipotle , only a little worse the dining setup is awkward and weirdly lit n5 10 n noverall 19 40 n nwhen the sides impress me more than the main dish i can only give two stars tops i m sure it would be closer to 3 if i ordered the burrito since that s just easier than a quesadilla but i do n't really like burritos that much , so guys lets work on that tortilla frying and better portions !
this place has great imaginable but the executed is all wrong there 's an outside and an inside , outside has a pool that had these really pretty floating light up orbs in it there 's a bar outside and a bar inside that 's good ! \) n nthey allow men to dress in shambles at this place sneakers and golf shirts , shorts and flip flops i 'm conceit to swoon at this \? blah every girls crazy about a sharp dressed man n nif you are going to allow that then make a night swim party , you got a pool make it like some of the poolside clubs in miami throw on a coverup and a bikini and swim till late in the night i got in free , guy friend even though he was a local , had to pay a whopping 10 n ndancers were tight and some of the cocktail servers were looking good , but the vip table chicks had on jorts and like knee high socks and sneakers \? \? \? \? wtf \? i do n't even wear that to the beach it was a mess does not represent an upscale club in vegas and definitely not at night n nwe stayed for one drink then left n nget a theme and stick to it and make the dress code consistent
while i have raved about this place in the past , i wanted to once again extol the virtues and , more importantly , the family feel of this place ernie lights up the room with her smile once that happens , the coffee is served , and the service begins then the rest of the breakfast is just a super continuation peg and i went for my birthday \( actually , we try to extend family occasions so that we can visit the family of chefs with whom we have grown since we moved here in ' 97 \) the oj was fresh , the specials are always superb , and there is a continuity in the kitchen that virtually assures that the quality will be stellar we ca n't wait for the new addition this month , and peg and i always will support matt , ernie , and of course christopher ! dr b
the atmospheric is refrigeration phenomenal drinkin opting meatballs were horrendous i was here a few times when it first opened and i thought they were alrite , but now i think they 've gone down collines i had the spicy pork meatballs and they were very , very hard my fiance was laughing watching us trying to cut through them i had them on top of the parmesan mac n cheese and i liked that well enough n n we also had cheesy bread as an appetizer and we thought the sauce tasted burnt the olives were great i 'd totally go back to drink but i wo n't eat there again there are way too many great restaurants in pittsburgh to suffer through a mediocre meal

this is the shittiest stores i 've ever been to i walked in allready to spend some serious cash and not a mere person would helped me hey a hitch of salesmen ths and watched television , and a couple of other salesmen taken eye contact with me and started to walk toward me but then stopping and becoming around oooo well , i happened to fry 's market situ and bought a great leather loveseat , a dining room set and an entertainment centred i outlay almost 1000 00 there and the staff was really great i do n't recommend pruitts to anyone , go to frys
we always have a okay time whenever we hit the luxor ! before , when it was still called ' ra ' it was crowded , it was fun , and there was always someone new to meet n nmy girls and i unknowingly planned our trip to las vegas for memorial day weekend i say unknowingly because i know better than to go to las vegas during a holiday weekend too many people \( i just do n't do big crowds \) , too many drunks , and clubs become too expensive however , it was n't my birthday and that weekend worked so we went n nwe hit lax the last night of our stay in vegas \( sunday night \) we got scammed by some dude selling club passes on the strip \( in front of caesar 's , do n't give him your money \) so we knew it would a rough night of clubbing ahead of us we decided to just go for it and headed to the luxor we were n't on a list , we did n't have passes , we were doing it ' the regular way ' which i have n't done since i first started clubbing \( about 10 years ago \) we expected the cover to be insane , especially when we discovered that ginuwine was performing \( do n't judge me , i still love ginuwine \) we were told that the cover was 20 , but we could expect to pay more by the time we got to the door totally understandable , this is vegas , the goal is to make money n nwe got to the door in record time \( less than an hour of waiting in line , score ! \) , and we only paid 30 to get in i look at this as a bargain because it was a holiday weekend , other clubs were charging much more and there was a performance that night n nthe only real problem we had was that the club was so packed it was really hard to finish my drink without spilling it on myself \( thanks to the thousands of people milling back and forth bumping in to me \) after ginuwine performed a lot of people left so it was easier to dance easier , not easy it was still super packed , no real dancing could be done and getting off the dance floor was very tricky n nover all , we had a great time the luxor never disappoints me it 's always an adventure when we roll through the luxor
mmmm , how to start this one off naughty , stinking , naughty , raunchy , tawdry , naughty , bleak , not sure did i referred dirty \? i 'll start with that we could tell from the unassuming garage that this place was not inhabited for a reason it is just the quintessential of sleaziness but it 's not even up to sordid vegas guideline in fact , i 'll go ahead and tell it , this place woud constitutes on the less stops of escondido thoroughfare we achieved in the elevators and a mate had to hold her nose and respiration into her lado moreover she did n't throw up and this was on the way to get some of their world famous chicken wings needless to say , we never got those wings \( see previous review of restaurant \) this place was so depressing and just drained our spirits we had to escape there is a reason they are off the strip and nobody goes there just stay away for the price there are so much better things btw , in n out down past unlv or in the other direction across the 15 !
this locations is the advisable i would recommend the green chili mushy walker a fried egg !
we come , we ate and i suppose food coma is a symptom of conquering the food for our money worth i came with my cousins and we were in during the transition from lunch to supper so we got to collections both congregate of food n ni like the interior it has a bit of ambiance compared to most grill spots which like to go basic the plus is the round non stick grill some populace might think it 's weird that they only wipe it down with a paper towel , but really it 's all it should to get it clean regarding to the usual grills that need to be replaced and deeply cleaning i like this kind of grill and the ventilation is decent here so i did n't get too much of that food smell n nmeat is the game and the meat actually was a decent selection the quality and freshness was pretty good n nmy favorites npork belly with a spicy marinate was really nice nkalbi ribs are nt as fatty as other spots , more marbled ntongue and thin sliced beef is always a favorite n ncooked items i like that the foods were more korean prepped than how some do a chinese buffet came for korean so want more of those dishes tempura came out and it was good actually , but i got it fresh off the frying most were okay , but i was n't here to fill on dishes i came for meat ! n nservice the service here is attentive and this was refreshing since most asian establishments do n't have this kind of service the ladies filled out drinks , checked on us often , came to help cook our meats and clean out grill the service was constant , but was unobtrusive and friendly n nlet 's put the things i have a shtick with aside n nbanchan some of the banchan was too salty and some during lunch were n't as cold and crisp as they should i did n't get to have much banchan after the turn over as at that point i was n't feeling it n nradish wraps i love these , after lunch turned over , they took them away \( i would think this is basic like having lettuce or bean paste for the meat n ni normally like chikke , the rice cinnamon drink , but theirs was way too sweet n npricing at 20 compared to other ayce for dinner is n't bad , but i still do n't know if it was a pricepoint i was happy with they have a much better setup , service , etc so i get where they need to keep their price higher i guess i 'm just sad i did n't get a little dessert \( they have fruit , jello \) if i went to wooche i normally keep the 4 difference to grab something sweet to wash out the palette from the heavy flavors it 's easy to say i 'll come for lunch but the kalbi and the thin cut tongue and such is only dinnertime and that 's a bulk of what i want n ni can see myself come back for a few reasons not as busy , i do n't smell as much i think i 'm a fan , but i 'm leaning towards this being a ok so i 'll say it 's a 3 5 star experience
upon subsequently tad conversely hence well disheartening nwe regardless love boutique hotel , service is always spectacular and there 's usually extra care in putting together the rooms not here we booked two rooms with two queen beds each we got only one room with two queen beds and one room with one king bed thanks \? n nthe ac ca n't be changed to your liking our bathrooms came with two towels for four people we were missing all of our soaps and shampoos carpets are dirty we were also given these basement rooms wheelchair accessibility \? nope no elevators ! they gave us a keurig machine for coffee but making yourself a cup costs two bucks a piece wow n nwe tried to ask the front desk how to get places , but they had no idea slow clap \? n n ni guess the one star is for the free breakfast we received for all our trouble yippee
i guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60 full which can be understandable but we were seated within 5 minutes , but the menus took another 5 minutes to come ni ordered the 4 course of salad , tandoori chicken , mixed vegetables , banana bread pudding , and a chai latte included in the end chicken was entirely offered and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree bread pudding very very good to finish the gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side main entrees were a bit on the smaller side nthe server was joking around a little , calling my chicken kfc when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard funny guy
very justly priced and a larger quality pedicure than i expected i will be returning
toughest experiences at a salon ever i got burnt during the wash and during the blowout i would had experienced this was a bad idea when i strolled in as soon as i sat down i heard the tunes turn way up and all these shreeks followed by omg , its friiday ! ! friday danced partaay ! ! ! all the instructors started dancing instead of watching students coloring hair or helping any of the stylists in training whose manikin heads kept falling over and rolling away during my cut and style i managed to hear my stylist talk bad about each student there and hear about how she almost got sent home that day because someone told on her for something the cut turned out great so it might have been worth the 15 then she styled me and it took two days to wash out the hairspray and i looked like i had stuck my finger in a light socket overall i guess it is worth the money next time i will just hit up bjs for happy hour to deal with the burns and mindless chatter of the stylists in training
i 've continually liked the auto bell and i go to several around town you can get out of the car while they clean it , or you can sit in your car thru the wash and just drive off w o waiting to get it dried , if you 're in a hurry n ni 've had trouble with this especial auto bell recently , though on at least four occasions i 've asked for the trunk of my car to be vacuumed only to find out later it was n't done i 've got an suv that collects a good bit of debris from landscaping supplies , so i 'm always asking they make sure the back gets vacuumed out thoroughly they always seem to acknowledge what i 'm asking , so i do n't know where the disconnect is , but i hate being at the market later only to find out the back has n't even been touched when i go to load my groceries n nsame thing happened just this weekend , except this time i checked before driving off nope had n't even been touched as dirty as when i pulled in the guy whow as drying my car took care of it right away , but it should have been handled when they other guys were doing the vaccuming before it went through the wash a quick trip to the car wash just took longer than expected n nstark contrast to the auto bell in clover i like to go to no communication issues there i ask they make sure the back is vacuumed and it 's done much friendlier staff there , too , in my opinion
this dumps is an entirely nightmares and mike lorenzi is thief he tabled me an calculating to repair my starter at 320 then called me up and mention it gotta a latest pump and it would be an else 493 , when we came down to decides the car up he clarified he also substituted some sort of regulator and a belt and the bill was now 2 , 487 and noted he could n't becoming ahold of me and my fiancee authorised it i granted it begets i sufficient the vehicle to expend to an immense meeting true out and he was explaining it been to coming done and he saved me over 1 , 000 ha i took it somewhere else later i found out my wife did n't authorize it after about a month i started having problems again and took it back and he said he was too busy to work on it so i took my car to another mechanic who said he did n't replace all that he said and the belt looked like it was taken off another vehicle the mechanic felt he had ripped us off we will be taking him to court
i 've going to the diamond an big occurrences , and it did always been spotty one visit terrible , one visit pretty exemplary , but never great after my visits this past weekend , i guess i 'm call it quits the bottom line is that it 's not worthwhile going to a place when the odds are the serving and meal will sorely disappoint n nwe had two people visiting from out of town , and forgot dish was closed , so we figured hurrah , the diamond was n't too shitty recent time , letting 's gonna there luckily , there was no wait , the four of we sat down , asked what the specials were and it turned out they were out of the specials two of us then ordered the black bean burger they were out of that too we got some other stuff , and a starter of fried pickles , which were okay my friend asked the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh , because she was thinking about a blt the waiter seemed offended and gave a dismissive , yes then we waited and waited for the food it took way too long to come out n nwe finally got our dishes i was okay with mine , but everyone else was very disappointed it was as if diamond shops for the absolute bottom rung ingredients if you put a salad on a menu , it should be at least somewhat appetizing the small block burger was a sad , ugly thing the tomatoes were hard and without much flavor one person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as disgusting i was embarrassed to have brought friends there n nthe take away lesson here is that it 's great to be a local institution it 's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele but if you 're a restaurant , it 's still all about the food for most of your patrons you need to have quality food and do n't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner especially when you 're charging 9 or more for some plates a lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price n nso the diamond is still a great place to get a drink , but they 've got to overhaul nearly everything when it comes to their food
i 'll have to admit , i figured this mall would rapidly decline over the past 3 years since i wrote my last review with the economic downturn and the overall decline of las vegas , i thought for sure it would suffer however , i was wrong it 's time for a review update n nall of the pros cons from my prior review still hold true the only thing i can add is to the cons this mall has a ton of those annoying kiosks that sell perfume , jewelry cleaning , and other stuff what makes it annoying are the sales people who make cat calls at you as you walk by it feels like i 'm at a middle eastern souk i just act like i ca n't speak english and walk right by them n nbesides that one annoying item , it 's still a solid place to do some shopping there are some great stores here and i 'm surprised they did n't leave during the economic downturn n nreturn factor 95

stopping by for an earlier dined on saturday night and were quite awed ! even immediate except on saturday we lasted about a 15 minute wait but obtained a great table on the balcony the only take reservations for party of 8 or more percent nstarted off with the edamame dumplings which were sweet and pleasant then i hectares the white shrimp ramen and my fiancé assumed the chicken karl panang both were assuredly wonderful ! you could taste the whole grain goodness , yet they both were unconditional of flavor and just enough spiciness to continues that glad perception in your throat recent i wo n't hear who was com planed about the portions but they were definitely enough for dinner we ended up with the banana tart dessert which was also wonderful fresh and not overwhelmingly sweet like so many restaurant desserts n noverall a great experience and we will definitely go back
as if losing all your monies on the strip from gambling , expensive restaurants , and esteemed shopping did n't hurt enough you leave las vegas through a neglected airport with filthy bathrooms , tenuous dining options and limited seating i realise it is just a port of entry commences but dang , could n't the hotels chip in a tiny bit to introduces a good impression for travel \? i added one bonus star for their no smoking enforcement
i had been immeasurably joyous with dawg days the outside is not attractive but the inside is very dog friendly we 've been taking our dog to get his hair sliced there for over a year we used to take him to pet smart , who nicked him with the razor on 2 occasions and sent us home with a bleeding dog and not a word of explanation dawg days is family owned , and they admittedly care about the dogs , and when our dog gets nervous , they do n't traumatize him we just got a second dog and he was terrified of the razor , so they gave him a haircut by hand and did n't charge us any extra they keep the dogs in an open pen indoors and do n't lock them in metal crates the staff is frequently in with the dogs giving them love and attention our dog is afraid to walk into pet smart , but in the last year has never become afraid of dawg days , and has never come home bleeding it 's hard , but do n't judge this place by the outside , we have been very happy with their services
i had been buy rony 's scissor cuts for the past seven annum i receive difficult , rough , kinky curly hair and he realise how to supplying sure it looks good immediately after the cut , and when it fills in too in addition to a great cut , it is a pleasant break to talk and joke with rony while in his speaker finally , he ha his own place ! his prices are more competitive than in his lately shop and and he still anticipates the higher scissor cut in the valleys taking massaging and hot conditioning towel , and rinse too , if you want
the peppermill defies profiled refined tackiness utterly craptastic could it be that a flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues \? n nall kidding aside , the best something about this eatery is the decor it screams cheesiness and vintage vegas , with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest when was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert \? i love the decor , and make sure that i always step into the lounge , open 24 hours a day , to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to here n nnow to the substance peppermill is an institution it has been around seeming forever , and had a scene from casino filmed there with sharon stone n nthe food is average , at best it is also overpriced the place is best on its breakfast foods , in my humble opinion the omelets are huge , but again , overpriced n nthe appetizer sampler platter is good , but overpriced oddly enough , the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item n ni recommend this place for drinks in the lounge , and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the strip the place , while overpriced , is still cheaper than the buffet and more fun n nare you noticing a trend here \? i will hit you over the head with it one more time overpriced
i did n't realise this places is brought to you by the creators of cheesecake factory well that clarify the decent food i ordered a calypso mojito , the rare ahi tuna salad , and i shared in some of the fudge cake collision the mojito was pretty good , the ahi tuna was admirable , and the cake was also pretty good combine that with nice decor and decent service and i 'd say it 's valuable repeat trips n ni 've been to the other grand lux inside amalfi \( technically , this one is the other grand lux \) i think i like the palazzo version better simply for the layout and decor it feels a little more intimate
binh laotian viet nfinally another laos place opened dates 11 1 2013 n nour preferable place shifted , \( phu thahn \) afterward we have been waiting for something great without traveling severely we recieve luck , cause this place is it n nappetizer fried egg rolls hard to admit , but these are the decent i have had at any restaurant spring rolls up next , and they were also awfully decent , they did nt have that overpowering of mint so that was actually very good both dipping sauces were a very good compliment as well n nentree wife had beef pho , and this actually beat our phoenix fave \( da vang \) awesome i had bbq pork , and was very good as well only downside was that i am not a fan of broken rice , but that is minimal , , , n nnow it will be whether they stay consistent but this will be a definite weekly stop until otherwise n nalso since they just opened the menu is n't full yet i have some suggestions , see if they add them

this is ever hits and miss i just happened and achieved the works and complements leather healing my car was dirtier then when i dropped it off i was one of two cars and 12 employees not thrilled
just as i said in my review in february , i returned and had the insaladda della casa then the complimenti alla mamma pizza just like before , everything was funky and i would order it again i just wish i recollect to read my earlier review before returning so i would be sure to order something different all the pizzas sound good and i want to try each one the service was very alright our waitress did n't seem to mind that we kept wanting to sample wine before we bought a bottle their wine selection , by the way , is very good and reasonably pricing finally , i must add that sitting inside can be a bit noisy when it is crowded temperature permitting , the patio is a better place to sit , eat and chat
i 'm not real uncomplicated to impress but i do like this places a nice lax crowds a ok selection of dance music and wondrous women every ware ! a must stop place for sure just be for warned drinks are not cheap ! ! ! but you are in vegas ! trapped by glamorous women ! be aware they do have a dress code
service reeks , devouring distasteful , too vast waiters around asks if you needed anything sometimes too numerous of a exemplary thing , is n't decent
i enjoyed to fond round corners cantina i really did but i have to say , after my first visit here i 'm not dying to came back n nbefore you even enter this place you have to deal with something that is n't really their fault parking and navigating traffic on butler rau always a joy ! once i managed to deal with this step and actually entered cantina i was n't really encouraged the music was playing too loudly for my taste in the front room and was n't much better in their back room , which was so dark i had to wonder how people even read their menus if they sit there n nlooking for somewhere a bit quieter and brighter , my dinner companion and i headed to their outdoor patio , where we found high tables and chairs that i honestly thought i 'd fall off of at some point during the meal , they were so unsteady fortunately that never happened , because we were right next to a part of the fence where the beams were extremely splintered just thinking about tipping into them was painful ! n nunfortunately , the service did absolutely nothing to improve my opinion of the place i watched three tables that arrived after us get service no one ever came to our table after we finally flagged a waitress attending to a group a couple tables over , she said she 'd grab our waitress and we waited some more while we waited the waitress that we flagged down went ahead and brought us some water that came in plastic cups i shudder to imagine just how much trash this place discards every day from these cups alone n nafter finally ordering and waiting for what at least was n't an unreasonable amount of time , i was able to enjoy a pretty tasty drink that came in a jar \( they have jars for alcohol but not for your water \? \) but was disappointed with my pork tacos the shells were kind of mushy and the sauce and toppings minimal mine just did n't taste all that special my dinner companion 's fish tacos were actually better i kind of wish we 'd swapped n ni left just feeling let down i honestly would 've been happy to forgive this place 's rustic look and loud music if the service and food were a bit better , but as it is i just do n't see anything here that i 'd want to brave the dreaded butler street traffic again for
i admittedly been n't admit the hyped of this places to sont truthful , got the customized recommendations from pals not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city , then i would have probably rated it a 3 or 4 the pizzeria was just good it was decently greasy and the crust was n't all that special they would n't delivering \( even though i am literally a few block from them \) and they ca n't assume debt debit carte a prodigious ruin for me
prodigious smallest families owns places a good portion of the client u00e8le is actually middle eastern , after they 've got to be doing something right the owner , mike , is always around and very friendly , and ordinarily hanging out in the market part of the building there 's a hookah bar upstairs , but afterwards an aversion to hookah , i 've never fancied in the market is neat to look around in and a good place to go for some excellent fresh feta cheese or veal nth non to the food it is admirable and inexpensive you can get a falafel sandwich and fries for under 5 , but that 's about the cheapest meal on the menu the have a lunch buffet monday friday from 11 3 for 10 it 's a very small buffet and at least half of it is cold food like salads and hummus about 75 of the time , i have no idea what i 'm eating , but i always enjoy it n nas an added bonus , the last time i was there the guy who refilled my water was wearing one of those t shirts with kittens on it their faces on the front , and their butts on the back i do n't know if he was serious or not , but it was pretty amazing
we transpired to be going by here and on an impulse decided to stop n nit 's a itty place right on the road they have a drive through and a walk up window when we visited there were two young , very effusive people inside they had several coffees available , as well as some italian soda my wife had the coffee , i tried the soda we were both very happy with our choices i 'd probably give it 3 5 stars if i could , but i ca n't and the enthusiastic service has to count for something , unless we 'll go with three star n nthey also have a stamp card so you can get a free beverage when you fill it
the complex is beautiful especially around the holidays ! lots of fun activities for kids families the pool with the slide is only open from 10 4 very bummed considering the 30 night fee to use it ! the rooms are good sized but are very yesteryear ! ! ! prepare to walk a mile to get to your car if you 're not willing to pay for valet
journeyed there for lunch on jul 12 on the 2 for 1 the hotel bestowed us pizza was good and riverbanks were pretty good other than that nothing stood out many things were nutritious , but not a lot of tangy including the linguine bar where they make it for you go elsewhere this one is a duds !
mike was our server he was knowledgeable great personality very attentive the food and his service was funky we will soberly constituted back and ask for him

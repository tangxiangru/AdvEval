despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
if you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at britney spears' movie starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch
those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know
does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago
it would work much better as a one hour tv documentary
the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard
a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well detailed characters
the overall vibe is druggy and self indulgent , like a spring break orgy for pretentious arts majors
i liked this film a lot
while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming of age films it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys' story
bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation
great character interaction
the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries
an instantly forgettable snow and stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday season product
well shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons
this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002
jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness
roman polanski 's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler 's list' it is more than merely a holocaust movie
an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment
a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households
payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he 's the best brush in the business
intriguing and stylish
the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood
a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot
wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
there are moments it can be heart rending in an honest and unaffected \( and gentle \) way
it 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries there 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls
a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences
godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence
arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation
assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne 's novel
all of the filmmakers' calculations ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness
eight legged freaks \? no big hairy deal
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a r sum loaded with credits like girl in bar 3
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple espresso endurance challenge
director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve
as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca n't remember a single name responsible for it
even in terms of the low grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash
a small movie with a big impact
it 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects
completely awful iranian drama as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque
the most anti human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero
while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine
if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks rent this movie and enjoy !
displaying about equal amounts of naivet , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential
